<p>This is me!</p>
<p>I am 18 years young, starting out my second year in the Graphic Design program. There are many things that I call myself. Designer, custome framer, artist, asian, boxer, food lover, music lover, beauty esthetic lover etc. I am currently working two part time jobs. One being a 'temporary part time' working midnights at the Chrysler plant and the second as a custome framer at Picture this Framing. When I am not working, in class or sleeping I am usually in the gym... or drinking. If I'm not doing any of those things I am probably with one of my two friends. No worries I am not a loner, I actually have three friends but the third is in prison. My goals in life right now are to finish school, save as much money as I can and spend as much time with my family as possible before I move away. I'm not 100% sure where I want to move and start my own roots but it is in my five year plan. I'm not quite sure what else I am say about myself. I just know that I put 110% into the things that I care about.</p>
<p>Here is a list of fun facts about me:</p>
<p>I drive a beautiful maroon 07 Jeep Wrangler that I take with me everywhere I go. </p>
<p>I have a white and grey husky named Layla</p>
<p>I have two brothers and 2 sisters (I am the second youngest)</p>
<p>I love the colour green!</p>
<p>My fun facts aren't that fun.. I apologize.</p>
